Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression 🚀
This project predicts the likelihood of diabetes using Logistic Regression, a machine learning classification algorithm. It analyzes patient health parameters like Glucose level, BMI, Age, and Blood Pressure to determine diabetes risk.


🔍 Overview
Diabetes is a widespread chronic disease, and early prediction can aid in prevention and management. This project uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset to train a logistic regression model and deploys it via Flask for easy user interaction.


🛠 Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Flask (Web App Deployment)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
HTML, CSS (Frontend)

📊 Dataset Features
Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness
Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age
Outcome (0: Non-Diabetic, 1: Diabetic)


💡 Workflow
Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, normalizing data.
Model Training – Applying Logistic Regression for classification.
Evaluation – Accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision-recall analysis.
Web Deployment – Flask-based interface for user input and predictions.
